## Home v2: Lab

Home infrastructure lab for a Proxmox + Talos Kubernetes cluster, managed with
Terraform and GitOps (Argo CD).

Start here:

- `AGENTS.md` for day-to-day operational runbook (rebuild, token rotation, TLS troubleshooting).
- `terraform/README.md` for quick commands.
- `terraform/OVERVIEW.md` for detailed architecture and file map.
