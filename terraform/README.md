## Lab Terraform Notes

This Terraform root manages NixOS VMs on Proxmox.

Active resources:

- `proxmox_virtual_environment_download_file.nixos_minimal_iso`
- `proxmox_virtual_environment_vm.partridge`
- `proxmox_virtual_environment_vm.magpie`

## Quick Ops

Load credentials:

```sh
set -a
source terraform/.env
set +a
```

Check the plan:

```sh
terraform -chdir=terraform plan
```

Apply the current stage:

```sh
terraform -chdir=terraform apply
```

Show VM outputs:

```sh
terraform -chdir=terraform output
```

## Repo-Managed VM

- Name: `partridge`
- Node: `sol`
- Root disk: 12 GiB on `local-lvm`
- Code disk: 5 GiB on `local-lvm`
- Postgres disk: 5 GiB on `local-lvm`
- Vaultwarden disk: 2 GiB on `local-lvm`
- Network bridge: `vmbr0`

`partridge` is managed by the root Nix flake as `.#partridge`.

## Disposable Dev VM

- Name: `magpie`
- Node: `sol`
- Root disk: 12 GiB on `local-lvm`
- Network bridge: `vmbr0`

`magpie` is managed by the root Nix flake as `.#magpie`. It starts from the
same Proxmox VM shape as `partridge` but only has a root disk. Terraform imports
a Nix-built qcow2 image into the root disk instead of booting the NixOS
installer ISO.

Build the image and apply Terraform with:

```sh
./scripts/magpie-terraform-apply.sh -auto-approve
```

That command must run somewhere that can build `x86_64-linux` NixOS images and
reach Proxmox, such as `partridge`. The generated image path is passed to
Terraform as `TF_VAR_magpie_image_path`.
